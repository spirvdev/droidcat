**droidcat** README file

## Installation

Droidcat binaries can't run directly inside the build directory, so on, you need to install the application by issuing a `ninja install` inside the generated _build_ directory!

> :bulb: **Tip**: You can install direct inside some system location like /usr/share/**droidcat** (HERE), but you will need the root user permissions for doing this!

For a better explanation for how the flow works, read the documents pages!
